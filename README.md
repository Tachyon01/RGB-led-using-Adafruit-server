# RGB-led-using-Adafruit-server

This is a simple project to connect to Adafruit.io and use the dashboard to update value of feed to change colour of RGB led.

Components Required:
1. NodeMCU
2. RGB Led

You will require an account of adafruit.io to use this project. Make a feed named 'Light' and on dashboard create a colour picker to update the colour of this feed which we will in turn use to change colour of our LED.

This can be furthur extended to make mood lights whose colour can be controlled remotely.
